# ALP (Assembly-Like Programming)

This project aims to produce a simple compiler from `.alp` (`assembly-like programming` source file) to machine code, made to run on our custom-made Micro-Controller Unit.

The project is called `assembly-like programming` as it's made for coding on the instruction level, but we will not limit ourselves to features commonly found in assembly languages.

# Features
- Custom instruction names and codes
- Automatic conversion from decimal to binary
- Comments
- Flag system for line jumps
